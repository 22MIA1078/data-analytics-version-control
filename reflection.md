# Reflection: Version Control in My Data Analytics Project

**Repository:** https://github.com/22MIA1078/data-analytics-version-control

## What I Set Up
- Installed Git and configured my username and email.
- Initialized a local repo and added starter analytics files (Python/R) with a README.
- Created a public GitHub repo and pushed commits.

## Why Version Control Matters
- **Reproducibility** of analyses with a clear history.
- **Collaboration** via branches and pull requests.
- **Safety** with easy rollback to stable versions.

## What I Learned
- Staging vs committing, and local vs remote repos.
- Writing meaningful commit messages.
- Connecting to GitHub and pushing changes.

## Challenges & Fixes
- Remote URL error: corrected the GitHub username and removed trailing `/` before pushing.
- Path confusion on Windows: verified location with `pwd`.

## Next Steps
- Add `data/` and ignore large/raw files.
- Use branches for new features and PR reviews.
- Add `requirements.txt` (Python) or `renv` (R) for environments.
